        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>Pune: In a significant move, the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) has introduced daily & monthly bus passes for people living in Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) areas.

         A new set of rates is being introduced where a daily pass for the entire operational area of PMPML will cost Rs 120 and a monthly pass will cost Rs 2700.
         
         As per information from PMPML, daily bus service is provided by PMPML in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad cities. Currently, the rate of a daily pass for bus service within the boundaries of one municipal body is Rs 40 and the rate of a monthly pass is Rs 900. For travelling in both municipalities (PMC & PCMC), the rate of a daily pass is Rs 50 and a monthly pass is Rs 1200.
         
         PMRDA workers, women and public representatives within the limits of PMRDA have requested daily and monthly bus passes along with increased frequency of PMPML buses.
         
         For monthly passes, the passengers should go to the nearest pass centre of the PMPML along with a photocopy of their Aadhaar card & photograph. For a daily pass, one can get it from the bus conductor by showing any one of the identification documents such as an Aadhaar card, PAN card, driving license, passport etc. The said pass facility will begin from September 4, 2023..</p>
